Any\ncommand line options (except \ninit_position\n, \nreplay\n, and \nkafka_version\n) may be given as\n\"key=value\" pairs.\n\n\nAdditionally, any configuration file options prefixed with 'kafka.' will be\npassed into the kafka producer library, after having 'kafka.' stripped off the\nfront of the key.  So, for example if config.properties contains\n\n\nkafka.batch.size=16384\n\n\n\n\nthen Maxwell will send \nbatch.size=16384\n to the kafka producer library.\n\n\nScoped environment variables\n\n\n\n\nIf \n--env_config_prefix\n configuration param is defined, for example, \n--env_config_prefix=MAXWELL_\n, or it is defined in the \nconfig.properties\n file, Maxwell will look up\nall the environment variables that start with \nMAXWELL_\n and strip off the prefix. The scoped environment variable names are case insensitive.\nFor instance if env contains\n\n\nMAXWELL_USER=mysql_user\n\n\n\n\nthen Maxwell will get \nuser=mysql_user\n config.\n\n\nThe configuration priority is\n\n\ncommand line options \n scoped env vars \n properties file \n default values\n\n\n\n\nGTID support\n\n\n\n\nAs of 1.8.0, Maxwell contains support for\n\nGTID-based replication\n.  Enable it with the \n--gtid_mode\n configuration param.\n\n\nHere's how you might configure your mysql server for GTID mode:\n\n\n$ vi my.cnf\n\n[mysqld]\nserver_id=1\nlog-bin=master\nbinlog_format=row\ngtid-mode=ON\nlog-slave-updates=ON\nenforce-gtid-consistency=true\n\n\n\n\nWhen in GTID-mode, Maxwell will transparently pick up a new replication\nposition after a master change.  Note that you will still have to re-point\nmaxwell to the new master.\n\n\nGTID support in Maxwell is considered alpha-quality at the moment; notably,\nMaxwell is unable to transparently upgrade from a traditional-replication\nscenario to a GTID-replication scenario; currently, when you enable gtid mode\nMaxwell will recapture the schema and GTID-position from \"wherever the master\nis at\".\n\n\nRDS configuration\n\n\n\n\nTo run Maxwell against RDS, (either Aurora or Mysql) you will need to do the following:\n\n\n\n\nset binlog_format to \"ROW\".  Do this in the \"parameter groups\" section.  For a Mysql-RDS instance this parameter will be\n  in a \"DB Parameter Group\", for Aurora it will be in a \"DB Cluster Parameter Group\".\n\n\nsetup RDS binlog retention as described \nhere\n.\n  The tl;dr is to execute \ncall mysql.rds_set_configuration('binlog retention hours', 24)\n on the server.\n\n\n\n\nFilters\n\n\n\n\nInclude/Exclude\n\n\nThe options \ninclude_dbs\n, \nexclude_dbs\n, \ninclude_tables\n, and \nexclude_tables\n control whether\nMaxwell will send an update for a given row to its producer.  All the options take a single value PATTERN,\nwhich may either be a literal table/database name, given as \noption=name\n, or a regular expression,\ngiven as \noption=/regex/\n.  The options are evaluated as follows:\n\n\n\n\nonly accept databases in \ninclude_dbs\n if non-empty\n\n\nreject databases in \nexclude_dbs\n\n\nonly accept tables in \ninclude_tables\n if non-empty\n\n\nreject tables in \nexclude_tables\n\n\n\n\nSo an example like \n--include_dbs=/foo.*/ --exclude_tables=bar\n will include \nfooty.zab\n and exclude \nfooty.bar\n\n\nThe option \nblacklist_tables\n and \nblacklist_dbs\n controls whether Maxwell will send updates for a table to its producer AND whether\nit captures schema changes for that table or database. Note that once Maxwell has been running with a table or database marked as blacklisted,\nyou \nmust\n continue to run Maxwell with that table or database blacklisted or else Maxwell will halt. If you want to stop\nblacklisting a table or database, you will have to drop the maxwell schema first.\n\n\nSupressing columns\n\n\nIf you wish to suppress columns from Maxwell's output (for instance, a password field),\nyou can use \nexclude_columns\n to filter out columns by name.\n\n\nFiltering on column values\n\n\nMaxwell can filter rows to only match when a column contains a specific value.  The \ninclude_column_values\n option takes a comma-separated\nlist of column/value pairs: \"bar=x,foo=y\".  Note that if a column does not exist in a table, it will ignore the value-filter.\n\n\nSchema storage host vs replica host\n\n\n\n\nMaxwell needs two sets of mysql permissions to operate properly: a mysql database in which to store schema snapshots,\nand a mysql host to replicate from.  The recommended configuration is that\nthese two functions are provided by a single mysql host.  In this case, just\nspecify \nhost\n, \nuser\n, etc.\n\n\nSome configurations, however, may need to write data to a different server than it replicates from.  In this case,\nthe host described by \nhost\n, \nuser\n, ..., will be used to write schema information to, and Maxwell will replicate\nevents from the host described by \nreplication_host\n, \nreplication_user\n, ...  Note that bootstrapping is not available\nin this configuration.\n\n\nIt's also possible to specify a different host to capture schema from than to\nreplicate from, via \nschema_host\n, ...  This is useful when using Maxscale as a\nreplication proxy.\n\n\nrunning multiple instances of maxwell against the same master\n\n\n\n\nMaxwell can operate with multiple instances running against a single master, in\ndifferent configurations.  This can be useful if you wish to have producers\nrunning in different configurations, for example producing different groups of\ntables to different topics.  Each instance of Maxwell must be configured with a\nunique \nclient_id\n, in order to store unique binlog positions.\n\n\nmultiple instances on a 5.5 server\n\n\n\n\nWith MySQL 5.5 and below, each replicator (be it mysql, maxwell, whatever) must\nalso be configured with a unique \nreplica_server_id\n.  This is a 32-bit integer\nthat corresponds to mysql's \nserver_id\n parameter.  The value you configure\nshould be unique across all mysql and maxwell instances.\n\n\nreference\n\n\n\n\nAt the minimum, you will need to specify 'host', 'user', 'password', 'producer'.\nThe kafka producer requires 'kafka.bootstrap.servers', the kinesis producer requires 'kinesis_stream'.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\noption\n\n\nargument\n\n\ndescription\n\n\ndefault\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngeneral options\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nconfig\n\n\nSTRING\n\n\nlocation of \nconfig.properties\n file\n\n\n$PWD/config.properties\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlog_level\n\n\n[debug \n info \n warn \n error]\n\n\nlog level\n\n\nINFO\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndaemon\n\n\n\n\nrunning maxwell as a daemon\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmysql options\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhost\n\n\nSTRING\n\n\nmysql host\n\n\nlocalhost\n\n\n\n\n\n\nuser\n\n\nSTRING\n\n\nmysql username\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\npassword\n\n\nSTRING\n\n\nmysql password\n\n\n(no password)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nport\n\n\nINT\n\n\nmysql port\n\n\n3306\n\n\n\n\n\n\njdbc_options\n\n\nSTRING\n\n\nmysql jdbc connection options\n\n\nzeroDateTimeBehavior=convertToNull\nconnectTimeout=5000\n\n\n\n\n\n\nschema_database\n\n\nSTRING\n\n\ndatabase to store schema and position in\n\n\nmaxwell\n\n\n\n\n\n\nclient_id\n\n\nSTRING\n\n\nunique text identifier for maxwell instance\n\n\nmaxwell\n\n\n\n\n\n\nreplica_server_id\n\n\nLONG\n\n\nunique numeric identifier for this maxwell instance\n\n\n6379 (see notes)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmaster_recovery\n\n\nBOOLEAN\n\n\nenable experimental master recovery code\n\n\nfalse\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngtid_mode\n\n\nBOOLEAN\n\n\nenable GTID-based replication\n\n\nfalse\n\n\n\n\n\n\nignore_producer_error\n\n\nBOOLEAN\n\n\nMaxwell will be terminated on kafka/kinesis errors when false.

For at-least-once delivery, you will want something more like:\n\n\nkafka.acks = all\nkafka.retries = 5 # or some larger number\n\n\n\n\nAnd you will also want to set \nmin.insync.replicas\n on Maxwell's output topic.\n\n\nKeys\n\n\nMaxwell generates keys for its Kafka messages based upon a mysql row's primary key in JSON format:\n\n\n{ \ndatabase\n:\ntest_tb\n,\ntable\n:\ntest_tbl\n,\npk.id\n:4,\npk.part2\n:\nhello\n}\n\n\n\n\nThis key is designed to co-operate with Kafka's log compaction, which will save the last-known\nvalue for a key, allowing Maxwell's Kafka stream to retain the last-known value for a row and act\nas a source of truth.\n\n\nThe JSON-hash based key format is tricky to regenerate in a stable fashion.  If you have an\napplication in which you need to parse and re-generate keys, it's advised you enable\n\n--kafka_key_format=array\n, which will generate kafka keys that can be parsed and re-output byte-for-byte.\n\n\nPartitioning\n\n\n\n\nBoth Kafka and AWS Kinesis support the notion of partitioned streams.\nPartitioning is controlled by \nproducer_partition_by\n, which gives you the\noption to split your stream by database, table, primary\nkey, or embedded columns.  How you choose to partition your streams influences\nquite a bit in downstream applications; generally the rule of thumb is to use\nthe finest-grained partition scheme that one can without sacrificing\nserialization needs.\n\n\nWhen using \nproducer_partition_by\n=\ncolumn\n you must set\n\nproducer_partition_columns\n with the column name(s) to partition by (e.g.\n\nproducer_partition_columns\n=user_id or\n\nproducer_partition_columns\n=user_id,create_date). You must also set\n\nproducer_partiton_by_fallback\n. This may be (\ndatabase\n, \ntable\n, \nprimary_key\n).\nIt is used when the column(s) specified does not exist in the current row. The\ndefault is \ndatabase\n.  When partitioning by \ncolumn\n Maxwell will treat the\nvalues for the specified columns as strings, concatenate them and use that\nvalue to partition the data. The above example, partitioning by user_id +\ncreate_date would have a partition key similar to \n1178532016-10-10 18:29:04\n.\n\n\nKafka partitioning\n\n\nA binlog event's partition is determined by the selected hash function and hash string as follows\n\n\n  HASH_FUNCTION(HASH_STRING) % TOPIC.NUMBER_OF_PARTITIONS\n\n\n\n\nThe HASH_FUNCTION is either java's \nhashCode\n or \nmurmurhash3\n. The default\nHASH_FUNCTION is \nhashCode\n. Murmurhash3 may be set with the\n\nkafka_partition_hash\n option. The seed value for the murmurhash function is\nhardcoded to 25342 in the MaxwellKafkaPartitioner class.\n\n\nThe HASH_STRING may be (\ndatabase\n, \ntable\n, \nprimary_key\n, \ncolumn\n).  The\ndefault HASH_STRING is the \ndatabase\n. The partitioning field can be configured\nusing the \nproducer_partition_by\n option.\n\n\nMaxwell will discover the number of partitions in its kafka topic upon boot.  This means that you should pre-create your kafka topics,\nand with at least as many partitions as you have logical databases:\n\n\nbin/kafka-topics.sh --zookeeper ZK_HOST:2181 --create \\\n                    --topic maxwell --partitions 20 --replication-factor 2\n\n\n\n\nhttp://kafka.apache.org/documentation.html#quickstart\n\n\nKinesis\n\n\n\n\nAWS Credentials\n\n\nYou will need to obtain an IAM user that has the following permissions for the stream you are planning on producing to:\n\n\n\n\n\"kinesis:PutRecord\"\n\n\n\"kinesis:PutRecords\"\n\n\n\"kinesis:DescribeStream\"\n\n\n\"cloudwatch:PutMetricData\"\n\n\n\n\nSee the \nAWS docs\n for the latest examples on which permissions are needed.\n\n\nThe producer uses the \nDefaultAWSCredentialsProviderChain\n class to gain aws credentials.\nSee the \nAWS docs\n on how to setup the IAM user with the Default Credential Provider Chain.\n\n\nOptions\n\n\nSet the output stream in \nconfig.properties\n by setting the \nkinesis_stream\n property.\n\n\nThe producer uses the \nKPL (Kinesis Producer Library)\n and uses the KPL built in configurations.\nCopy \nkinesis-producer-library.properties.example\n to \nkinesis-producer-library.properties\n and configure the properties file to your needs.\n\n\nYou are \nrequired\n to configure the region. For example:\n\n\n# set explicitly\nRegion=us-west-2\n# or set with an environment variable\nRegion=$AWS_DEFAULT_REGION\n\n\n\n\nBy default, the KPL implements \nrecord aggregation\n, which usually increases producer throughput by allowing you to increase the number of records sent per API call. However, aggregated records are encoded differently (using Google Protocol Buffers) than records that are not aggregated. Therefore, if you are not using the \nKCL (Kinesis Client Library)\n to consume records (for example, you are using AWS Lambda) you will need to either disaggregate the records in your consumer (for example, by using the \nAWS Kinesis Aggregation library\n), or disable record aggregation in your \nkinesis-producer-library.properties\n configuration.\n\n\nTo disable aggregation, add the following to your configuration:\n\n\nAggregationEnabled=false\n\n\n\n\nRemember: if you disable record aggregation, you will lose the benefit of potentially greater producer throughput.\n\n\nSQS\n\n\n\n\nAWS Credentials\n\n\nYou will need to obtain an IAM user that has the permission to access the SQS service. The SQS producer also uses \nDefaultAWSCredentialsProviderChain\n to get AWS credentials.\n\n\nSee the \nAWS docs\n on how to setup the IAM user with the Default Credential Provider Chain.\n\n\nIn case you need to set up a different region also along with credentials then default one, see the \nAWS docs\n.\n\n\nOptions\n\n\nSet the output queue in the \nconfig.properties\n by setting the \nsqs_queue_uri\n property to full SQS queue uri from AWS console.\n\n\nThe producer uses the \nAWS SQS SDK\n.\n\n\nGoogle Cloud Pub/Sub\n\n\n\n\nIn order to publish to Google Cloud Pub/Sub, you will need to obtain an IAM service account that has been granted the \nroles/pubsub.publisher\n role.\n\n\nSee the Google Cloud Platform docs for the \nlatest examples of which permissions are needed\n, as well as \nhow to properly configure service accounts\n.\n\n\nSet the output stream in \nconfig.properties\n by setting the \npubsub_project_id\n and \npubsub_topic\n properties. Optionally configure a dedicated output topic\nfor DDL updates by setting the \nddl_pubsub_topic\n property.\n\n\nThe producer uses the \nGoogle Cloud Java Library for Pub/Sub\n and uses its built-in configurations.\n\n\nRabbitMQ\n\n\n\n\nTo produce messages to RabbitMQ, you will need to specify a host in \nconfig.properties\n with \nrabbitmq_host\n. This is the only required property, everything else falls back to a sane default.\n\n\nThe remaining configurable properties are:\n- \nrabbitmq_user\n - defaults to \nguest\n\n- \nrabbitmq_pass\n - defaults to \nguest\n\n- \nrabbitmq_virtual_host\n - defaults to \n/\n\n- \nrabbitmq_exchange\n - defaults to \nmaxwell\n\n- \nrabbitmq_exchange_type\n - defaults to \nfanout\n\n- \nrabbitmq_exchange_durable\n - defaults to \nfalse\n\n- \nrabbitmq_exchange_autodelete\n - defaults to \nfalse\n\n- \nrabbitmq_routing_key_template\n - defaults to \n%db%.%table%\n\n    - This config controls the routing key, where \n%db%\n and \n%table%\n are placeholders that will be substituted at runtime\n- \nrabbitmq_message_persistent\n - defaults to \nfalse\n\n- \nrabbitmq_declare_exchange\n - defaults to \ntrue\n\n\nFor more details on these options, you are encouraged to the read official RabbitMQ documentation here: https://www.rabbitmq.com/documentation.html\n\n\nRedis\n\n\n\n\nSet the output stream in \nconfig.properties\n by setting the \nredis_pub_channel\n property for redis_type = pubsub or set the \nredis_list_key\n property when using redis_type = lpush.\n\n\nOther configurable properties are:\n\n\n\n\nredis_host\n - defaults to \nlocalhost\n\n\nredis_port\n - defaults to \n6379\n\n\nredis_auth\n - defaults to \nnull\n\n\nredis_database\n - defaults to \n0\n\n\nredis_type\n - defaults to \npubsub\n\n\nredis_list_key\n - defaults to \nmaxwell\n\n\n\n\nCustom Producer\n\n\n\n\nIf none of the producers packaged with Maxwell meet your requirements, a custom producer can be added at runtime. The producer is responsible for processing the raw database rows. Note that your producer may receive DDL and heartbeat rows as well, but your producer can easily filter them out (see example).\n\n\nIn order to register your custom producer, you must implement the \nProducerFactory\n interface, which is responsible for creating your custom \nAbstractProducer\n. Next, set the \ncustom_producer.factory\n configuration property to your \nProducerFactory\n's fully qualified class name. Then add the custom \nProducerFactory\n and all its dependencies to the $MAXWELL_HOME/lib directory.\n\n\nYour custom producer will likely require configuration properties as well. For that, use the \ncustom_producer.*\n property namespace. Those properties will be exposed to your producer via \nMaxwellConfig.customProducerProperties\n.\n\n\nCustom producer factory and producer examples can be found here: \nhttps://github.com/zendesk/maxwell/tree/master/src/example/com/zendesk/maxwell/example/producerfactory",

When Maxwell detects that it is talking to a new \nserver_id\n (one that differs from its stored \nposition\n), it attempts a master failover (if enabled).

If maxwell can't shut down (because the kafka\n   producer is in a bad state and \nclose()\n never terminates, for example),\n   it would previously stall and process no messages. Now, shutdown is run\n   in a separate thread and there is an additional watchdog thread which\n   forcibly kills the maxwell process if it can't shut down within 10\n   seconds.\n\n\nInitial support for running maxwell from java, rather then as its own\n   process.

Also a bunch of good refactoring has been done for heartbeat processing. List of changes:   \n\n\n\n\nSupport Kafka 0.10.2   \n\n\nStop procesing RDS hearbeats   \n\n\nKeep maxwell heartbeat going every 10 seconds when database is quiet   \n\n\nAllow for empty double-quoted string literals for database schema changes   \n\n\nIgnore Kafka/Kinesis producer errors based on new configuration ignore_producer_error\n\n\n\n\nv1.10.0\n: \"slightly more ones than zeroes\"\n\n\nThis is a small release, primarily around a change to how schemas are\nstored. Maxwell now stores the \nlast_heartbeat_read\n with each entry\nin the \nschemas\n table, making schema management more resilient to\ncases where binlog numbers are reused, but means that you must take\ncare if you need to roll back to an earlier version. If you deploy\nv1.10.0, then roll back to an earlier version, you should manually\nupdate all \nschemas\n.\nlast_heartbeat_read\n values to \n0\n before\nredeploying v1.10.0 or higher.\n\n\nOther minor changes:\n\n\n\n\nallow negative default numbers in columns\n\n\nonly store final binlog position if it has changed\n\n\nblacklist internal aurora table `rds_heartbeat*'\n\n\nlog4j version bump (allows for one entry per line JSON logging)\n\n\n\n\nv1.9.0\n: \"now with added whimsy\"\n\n\nMaxwell 1.9 adds one main feature: monitoring support, contributed by\nScott Ferguson.

This timeout can be set as a heuristic; after this many\nmilliseconds, maxwell will consider an outstanding message lost and fail it.\n\n\n\n\nConfiguration methods\n\n\n\n\nMaxwell is configurable via the command-line, a properties file, or the environment.\nThe configuration priority is:\n\n\ncommand line options > scoped env vars > properties file > default values\n\n\n\n\nconfig.properties\n\n\nMaxwell can be configured via a java properties file, specified via \n--config\n\nor named \"config.properties\" in the current working directory.\nAny command line options (except \ninit_position\n, \nreplay\n, \nkafka_version\n and\n\ndaemon\n) may be specified as \"key=value\" pairs.\n\n\nvia environment\n\n\nIf \nenv_config_prefix\n given via command line or in \nconfig.properties\n, Maxwell\nwill configure itself with all environment variables that match the prefix. The\nenvironment variable names are case insensitive.  For example, if maxwell is\nstarted with \n--env_config_prefix=FOO_\n and the environment contains \nFOO_USER=auser\n,\nthis would be equivalent to passing \n--user=auser\n.\n\n\nDeployment scenarios\n\n\n\n\nAt a minimum, Maxwell needs row-level-replication turned on into order to\noperate:\n\n\n[mysqld]\nserver_id=1\nlog-bin=master\nbinlog_format=row\n\n\n\n\nGTID support\n\n\nAs of 1.8.0, Maxwell contains support for\n\nGTID-based replication\n.  Enable it with the \n--gtid_mode\n configuration param.\n\n\nHere's how you might configure your mysql server for GTID mode:\n\n\n$ vi my.cnf\n\n[mysqld]\nserver_id=1\nlog-bin=master\nbinlog_format=row\ngtid-mode=ON\nlog-slave-updates=ON\nenforce-gtid-consistency=true\n\n\n\n\nWhen in GTID-mode, Maxwell will transparently pick up a new replication\nposition after a master change.  Note that you will still have to re-point\nmaxwell to the new master.\n\n\nGTID support in Maxwell is considered alpha-quality at the moment; notably,\nMaxwell is unable to transparently upgrade from a traditional-replication\nscenario to a GTID-replication scenario; currently, when you enable gtid mode\nMaxwell will recapture the schema and GTID-position from \"wherever the master\nis at\".\n\n\nRDS configuration\n\n\nTo run Maxwell against RDS, (either Aurora or Mysql) you will need to do the following:\n\n\n\n\nset binlog_format to \"ROW\".  Do this in the \"parameter groups\" section.  For a Mysql-RDS instance this parameter will be\n  in a \"DB Parameter Group\", for Aurora it will be in a \"DB Cluster Parameter Group\".\n\n\nsetup RDS binlog retention as described \nhere\n.\n  The tl;dr is to execute \ncall mysql.rds_set_configuration('binlog retention hours', 24)\n on the server.\n\n\n\n\nSplit server roles\n\n\nMaxwell uses MySQL for 3 different functions:\n\n\n\n\nA host to store the captured schema in (\n--host\n).\n\n\nA host to replicate from (\n--replication_host\n).\n\n\nA host to capture the schema from (\n--schema_host\n).\n\n\n\n\nOften, all three hosts are the same.  \nhost\n and \nreplication_host\n should be different\nif mysql is chained off a slave.  \nschema_host\n should only be used when using the\nmaxscale replication proxy.\n\n\nNote that bootstrapping is currently not available when \nhost\n and\n\nreplication_host\n are separate, due to some implementation details.\n\n\nMultiple Maxwell Instances\n\n\nMaxwell can operate with multiple instances running against a single master, in\ndifferent configurations.  This can be useful if you wish to have producers\nrunning in different configurations, for example producing different groups of\ntables to different topics.  Each instance of Maxwell must be configured with a\nunique \nclient_id\n, in order to store unique binlog positions.\n\n\nWith MySQL 5.5 and below, each replicator (be it mysql, maxwell, whatever) must\nalso be configured with a unique \nreplica_server_id\n.  This is a 32-bit integer\nthat corresponds to mysql's \nserver_id\n parameter.  The value you configure\nshould be unique across all mysql and maxwell instances.",

            "text": "Kafka\n\n\n\n\nTopic\n\n\nMaxwell writes to a kafka topic named \"maxwell\" by default. It can be static,\ne.g. 'maxwell', or dynamic, e.g. \nnamespace_%{database}_%{table}\n. In the\nlatter case 'database' and 'table' will be replaced with the values for the row\nbeing processed. This can be changed with the \nkafka_topic\n option.\n\n\nClient version\n\n\nBy default, maxwell uses the kafka 1.0.0 library. The \n--kafka_version\n flag\nlets you choose an alternate library version: 0.8.2.2, 0.9.0.1, 0.10.0.1, 0.10.2.1 or\n0.11.0.1, 1.0.0.  This flag is only available on the command line.\n\n\n\n\nThe 0.8.2.2 client is only compatible with brokers running kafka 0.8.\n\n\nThe 0.10.0.x client is only compatible with brokers 0.10.0.x or later.\n\n\nMixing the 0.10 client with other versions can lead to serious performance impacts.\n  For More details, \nread about it here\n.\n\n\nThe 0.11.0 client can talk to version 0.10.0 or newer brokers.\n\n\nThe 0.9.0.1 client is not compatible with brokers running kafka 0.8. The exception below will show in logs when that is the case:\n\n\n\n\nERROR Sender - Uncaught error in kafka producer I/O thread:\nSchemaException: Error reading field 'throttle_time_ms': java.nio.BufferUnderflowException\n\n\n\n\nExtended options\n\n\nAny options given to Maxwell that are prefixed with \nkafka.\n will be passed directly into the Kafka producer configuration\n(with \nkafka.\n stripped off).  We use the \"new producer\" configuration, as described here:\n\nhttp://kafka.apache.org/documentation.html#newproducerconfigs\n\n\nPerformant properties\n\n\nThese properties would give high throughput performance.\n\n\nkafka.acks = 1\nkafka.compression.type = snappy\nkafka.retries=0\n\n\n\n\nAt-least-once properties\n\n\nFor at-least-once delivery, you will want something more like:\n\n\nkafka.acks = all\nkafka.retries = 5 # or some larger number\n\n\n\n\nAnd you will also want to set \nmin.insync.replicas\n on Maxwell's output topic.\n\n\nKeys\n\n\nMaxwell generates keys for its Kafka messages based upon a mysql row's primary key in JSON format:\n\n\n{ \"database\":\"test_tb\",\"table\":\"test_tbl\",\"pk.id\":4,\"pk.part2\":\"hello\"}\n\n\n\n\nThis key is designed to co-operate with Kafka's log compaction, which will save the last-known\nvalue for a key, allowing Maxwell's Kafka stream to retain the last-known value for a row and act\nas a source of truth.\n\n\nThe JSON-hash based key format is tricky to regenerate in a stable fashion.  If you have an\napplication in which you need to parse and re-generate keys, it's advised you enable\n\n--kafka_key_format=array\n, which will generate kafka keys that can be parsed and re-output byte-for-byte.\n\n\nPartitioning\n\n\n\n\nBoth Kafka and AWS Kinesis support the notion of partitioned streams.\nPartitioning is controlled by \nproducer_partition_by\n, which gives you the\noption to split your stream by database, table, primary\nkey, or column data.  How you choose to partition will influence the consumers\nof the maxwell stream.  A good rule of thumb is to use the finest-grained\npartition scheme possible given serialization constraints.\n\n\nTo partition by column data, you must set both:\n\n\n\n\nproducer_partition_columns\n, a comma-separated list of column names, and\n\n\nproducer_partiton_by_fallback\n. This may be (\ndatabase\n, \ntable\n,\n  \nprimary_key\n), and will be used as a default value when the column does not\n  exist.\n\n\n\n\nWhen partitioning by column Maxwell will treat the values for the specified\ncolumns as strings, concatenate them and use that value to partition the data.\n\n\nKafka partitioning\n\n\nA binlog event's partition is determined by the selected hash function and hash string as follows\n\n\n  HASH_FUNCTION(HASH_STRING) % TOPIC.NUMBER_OF_PARTITIONS\n\n\n\n\nThe HASH_FUNCTION is either java's \nhashCode\n or \nmurmurhash3\n. The default\nHASH_FUNCTION is \nhashCode\n. Murmurhash3 may be set with the\n\nkafka_partition_hash\n option. The seed value for the murmurhash function is\nhardcoded to 25342 in the MaxwellKafkaPartitioner class.\n\n\nThe HASH_STRING may be (\ndatabase\n, \ntable\n, \nprimary_key\n, \ncolumn\n).  The\ndefault HASH_STRING is the \ndatabase\n. The partitioning field can be configured\nusing the \nproducer_partition_by\n option.\n\n\nMaxwell will discover the number of partitions in its kafka topic upon boot.  This means that you should pre-create your kafka topics,\nand with at least as many partitions as you have logical databases:\n\n\nbin/kafka-topics.sh --zookeeper ZK_HOST:2181 --create \\\n                    --topic maxwell --partitions 20 --replication-factor 2\n\n\n\n\nhttp://kafka.apache.org/documentation.html#quickstart\n\n\nKinesis\n\n\n\n\nAWS Credentials\n\n\nYou will need to obtain an IAM user that has the following permissions for the stream you are planning on producing to:\n\n\n\n\n\"kinesis:PutRecord\"\n\n\n\"kinesis:PutRecords\"\n\n\n\"kinesis:DescribeStream\"\n\n\n\"cloudwatch:PutMetricData\"\n\n\n\n\nSee the \nAWS docs\n for the latest examples on which permissions are needed.\n\n\nThe producer uses the \nDefaultAWSCredentialsProviderChain\n class to gain aws credentials.\nSee the \nAWS docs\n on how to setup the IAM user with the Default Credential Provider Chain.\n\n\nOptions\n\n\nSet the output stream in \nconfig.properties\n by setting the \nkinesis_stream\n property.\n\n\nThe producer uses the \nKPL (Kinesis Producer Library)\n and uses the KPL built in configurations.\nCopy \nkinesis-producer-library.properties.example\n to \nkinesis-producer-library.properties\n and configure the properties file to your needs.\n\n\nYou are \nrequired\n to configure the region. For example:\n\n\n# set explicitly\nRegion=us-west-2\n# or set with an environment variable\nRegion=$AWS_DEFAULT_REGION\n\n\n\n\nBy default, the KPL implements \nrecord aggregation\n, which usually increases producer throughput by allowing you to increase the number of records sent per API call. However, aggregated records are encoded differently (using Google Protocol Buffers) than records that are not aggregated. Therefore, if you are not using the \nKCL (Kinesis Client Library)\n to consume records (for example, you are using AWS Lambda) you will need to either disaggregate the records in your consumer (for example, by using the \nAWS Kinesis Aggregation library\n), or disable record aggregation in your \nkinesis-producer-library.properties\n configuration.\n\n\nTo disable aggregation, add the following to your configuration:\n\n\nAggregationEnabled=false\n\n\n\n\nRemember: if you disable record aggregation, you will lose the benefit of potentially greater producer throughput.\n\n\nSQS\n\n\n\n\nAWS Credentials\n\n\nYou will need to obtain an IAM user that has the permission to access the SQS service. The SQS producer also uses \nDefaultAWSCredentialsProviderChain\n to get AWS credentials.\n\n\nSee the \nAWS docs\n on how to setup the IAM user with the Default Credential Provider Chain.\n\n\nIn case you need to set up a different region also along with credentials then default one, see the \nAWS docs\n.\n\n\nOptions\n\n\nSet the output queue in the \nconfig.properties\n by setting the \nsqs_queue_uri\n property to full SQS queue uri from AWS console.\n\n\nThe producer uses the \nAWS SQS SDK\n.\n\n\nGoogle Cloud Pub/Sub\n\n\n\n\nIn order to publish to Google Cloud Pub/Sub, you will need to obtain an IAM service account that has been granted the \nroles/pubsub.publisher\n role.\n\n\nSee the Google Cloud Platform docs for the \nlatest examples of which permissions are needed\n, as well as \nhow to properly configure service accounts\n.\n\n\nSet the output stream in \nconfig.properties\n by setting the \npubsub_project_id\n and \npubsub_topic\n properties. Optionally configure a dedicated output topic\nfor DDL updates by setting the \nddl_pubsub_topic\n property.\n\n\nThe producer uses the \nGoogle Cloud Java Library for Pub/Sub\n and uses its built-in configurations.\n\n\nRabbitMQ\n\n\n\n\nTo produce messages to RabbitMQ, you will need to specify a host in \nconfig.properties\n with \nrabbitmq_host\n. This is the only required property, everything else falls back to a sane default.\n\n\nThe remaining configurable properties are:\n- \nrabbitmq_user\n - defaults to \nguest\n\n- \nrabbitmq_pass\n - defaults to \nguest\n\n- \nrabbitmq_virtual_host\n - defaults to \n/\n\n- \nrabbitmq_exchange\n - defaults to \nmaxwell\n\n- \nrabbitmq_exchange_type\n - defaults to \nfanout\n\n- \nrabbitmq_exchange_durable\n - defaults to \nfalse\n\n- \nrabbitmq_exchange_autodelete\n - defaults to \nfalse\n\n- \nrabbitmq_routing_key_template\n - defaults to \n%db%.%table%\n\n    - This config controls the routing key, where \n%db%\n and \n%table%\n are placeholders that will be substituted at runtime\n- \nrabbitmq_message_persistent\n - defaults to \nfalse\n\n- \nrabbitmq_declare_exchange\n - defaults to \ntrue\n\n\nFor more details on these options, you are encouraged to the read official RabbitMQ documentation here: https://www.rabbitmq.com/documentation.html\n\n\nRedis\n\n\n\n\nSet the output stream in \nconfig.properties\n by setting the \nredis_pub_channel\n property for redis_type = pubsub or set the \nredis_list_key\n property when using redis_type = lpush.\n\n\nOther configurable properties are:\n\n\n\n\nredis_host\n - defaults to \nlocalhost\n\n\nredis_port\n - defaults to \n6379\n\n\nredis_auth\n - defaults to \nnull\n\n\nredis_database\n - defaults to \n0\n\n\nredis_type\n - defaults to \npubsub\n\n\nredis_list_key\n - defaults to \nmaxwell\n\n\n\n\nCustom Producer\n\n\n\n\nIf none of the producers packaged with Maxwell meet your requirements, a custom producer can be added at runtime. The producer is responsible for processing the raw database rows. Note that your producer may receive DDL and heartbeat rows as well, but your producer can easily filter them out (see example).\n\n\nIn order to register your custom producer, you must implement the \nProducerFactory\n interface, which is responsible for creating your custom \nAbstractProducer\n. Next, set the \ncustom_producer.factory\n configuration property to your \nProducerFactory\n's fully qualified class name. Then add the custom \nProducerFactory\n and all its dependencies to the $MAXWELL_HOME/lib directory.\n\n\nYour custom producer will likely require configuration properties as well. For that, use the \ncustom_producer.*\n property namespace. Those properties will be exposed to your producer via \nMaxwellConfig.customProducerProperties\n.\n\n\nCustom producer factory and producer examples can be found here: \nhttps://github.com/zendesk/maxwell/tree/master/src/example/com/zendesk/maxwell/example/producerfactory",

            "text": "Basic Filters\n\n\n\n\nMaxwell can be configured to filter out updates from specific tables.  This is controlled\nby the \n--filter\n command line flag.\n\n\nExample 1\n\n\n--filter = 'exclude: foodb.*, include: foodb.tbl, include: foodb./table_\\d+/'\n\n\n\n\nThis example tells Maxwell to suppress all updates that happen on \nfoodb\n, except for updates\nto \ntbl\n and any table in foodb matching the regexp \n/table_\\d+/\n.\n\n\nExample 2\n\n\nFilter options are evaluated in the order specified, so in this example we\nsuppress everything except updates in the \ndb1\n database.\n\n\n--filter = 'exclude: *.*, include: db1.*'\n\n\n\n\nColumn Filters\n\n\n\n\nMaxwell can also include/exclude based on column values:\n\n\n--filter = 'exclude: db.tbl.col = reject'\n\n\n\n\nwill reject any row in \ndb.tbl\n that contains \ncol\n and where the stringified value of \"col\" is \"reject\".\n\n\nMissing Columns\n\n\nColumn filters are ignored if the specified column is not present, so:\n\n\n--filter = 'exclude: *.*.col_a = *'\n\n\n\n\nwill exclude updates to any table that contains \ncol_a\n, but include every other table.\n\n\nBlacklisting\n\n\n\n\nIn rare cases, you may wish to tell Maxwell to completely ignore a database or\ntable, including schema changes.  In general, don't use this.  If you must use this:\n\n\n--filter = 'blacklist: bad_db.*'\n\n\n\n\nNote that once Maxwell has been running with a table or database marked as\nblacklisted, you \nmust\n continue to run Maxwell with that table or database\nblacklisted or else Maxwell will halt. If you want to stop\nblacklisting a table or database, you will have to drop the maxwell schema first.\n\n\nJavascript Filters\n\n\n\n\nIf you need more flexibility than the native filters provide, you can write a small chunk of\njavascript for Maxwell to pass each row through with \n--javascript FILE\n.  This file should contain\nat least a javascript function named \nprocess_row\n.  This function will be passed a \nWrappedRowMap\n\nobject and is free to make filtering and data munging decisions:\n\n\nfunction process_row(row) {\n    if ( row.database == \"test\" && row.table == \"bar\" ) {\n        var username = row.data.get(\"username\");\n        if ( username == \"osheroff\" )\n            row.suppress();\n\n        row.data.put(\"username\", username.toUpperCase());\n    }\n}\n\n\n\n\nThere's a longer example here: \nhttps://github.com/zendesk/maxwell/blob/master/src/example/filter.js\n.",

Most users won't need to know how this works, but it can be useful in the rare case where something goes wrong.\n\n\nMySQL binlogs give maxwell access to the raw bytes for each update that happens. In order to generate useful output, Maxwell needs to know the data type of every column, so that it can interpret the bytes as a number, string, boolean, etc.\n\n\nThere is a set of \"base schema\" tables in the maxwell database - \ntables\n, \ncolumns\n, \ndatabases\n. This is where we capture the initial schema, the first time Maxwell is run.\n\n\nAs time progresses, maxwell will see any modifications you make to the schema (these are part of the binlog). As each change occurs, Maxwell will generate an internal representation of what changed. Maxwell stores these diffs in the \nschemas\n table - each diff contains the following information to place it in the timeline of your database:\n\n\n\n\nbinlog_file\n, \nbinlog_position\n (or \ngtid_set\n): the exact point in the binlog stream where the schema change occurred\n\n\ndeltas\n: the internal representation of the schema change\n\n\nbase_schema_id\n: the previous schema that this delta applies to\n\n\nlast_heartbeat_read\n: the most recent maxwell heartbeat seen in the binlog prior to this change\n\n\nserver_id\n: the server which this schema applies to\n\n\n\n\nThis information creates a concrete timeline of the history of your schema for a given server. Given any binlog file+position (or gtid) and a last_heartbeat value, the current schema can be found by finding the \"most recent\" schema for this server_id, then following the chain of \nbase_schema_id\n until it terminates (in a \nnull\n, which means we've reached the initial captured schema).\n\n\n\"Most recent\" should be fairly intuitive - firstly we sort by \nlast_heartbeat_read\n, then by \nbinlog_file\n, then \nbinlog_position\n. We limit the search to values \"before\" the binlog position we're searching for, because we don't want to use a schema corresponding to a change that is \"in the future\" - i.e. further ahead in the binlog than our current position.\n\n\nMaster failover\n\n\n\n\nSchemas are important for master failover. When Maxwell detects that it is talking to a new \nserver_id\n (one that differs from its stored \nposition\n), it attempts a master failover (if enabled). It searches backwards in the new servers binlog files, looking for an update to \nmaxwell.heartbeats\n corresponding to the timestamp stored in its position table.\n\n\nOnce it finds this (unique) update, it knows the binlog location for both the old and new master which correspond to the exact same event.\n\n\nUsing this information, maxwell creates a merge point - it finds the active schema for the old master's stored position, and then creates a new schema entry with an empty delta, the new \nserver_id\n, and a base_schema_id of the previous schema. In this way, Maxwell is able to create a chain of schema updates even across different servers with different sets of binlogs.",

It will differ\nfrom normal Maxwell operation in that:\n\n\n\n\nINSERT statements will no longer output a column's default value\n\n\nUPDATE statements will be incomplete; Maxwell outputs as much of the row as given in the binlogs,\n  but \ndata\n will only include what is needed to perform the update (generally, id columns and changed columns).\n  The \nold\n section may or may not be included, depending on the nature of the update.\n\n\nDELETE statements will be incomplete; generally they will only include the primary key.\n\n\n\n\nMaster recovery\n\n\n\n\nAs of 1.2.0, maxwell includes experimental support for master position recovery.

This is\nlargely compatible with the previous OpenReplicator implementation, but there are some differences:\n\n\n\n\nTIMESTAMP columns are always treated as UTC, regardless of your timezone.

Now, shutdown is run\n   in a separate thread and there is an additional watchdog thread which\n   forcibly kills the maxwell process if it can't shut down within 10\n   seconds.\n\n\nInitial support for running maxwell from java, rather then as its own\n   process.

If you deploy\nv1.10.0, then roll back to an earlier version, you should manually\nupdate all \nschemas\n.\nlast_heartbeat_read\n values to \n0\n before\nredeploying v1.10.0 or higher.\n\n\nOther minor changes:\n\n\n\n\nallow negative default numbers in columns\n\n\nonly store final binlog position if it has changed\n\n\nblacklist internal aurora table `rds_heartbeat*'\n\n\nlog4j version bump (allows for one entry per line JSON logging)\n\n\n\n\nv1.9.0\n: \"now with added whimsy\"\n\n\nMaxwell 1.9 adds one main feature: monitoring support, contributed by\nScott Ferguson.

Did I ever mention blacklists\n  are a terrible idea?   v1.18.0 : \"hello from the Andes\"   memory optimizations for large schemas (especially shareded schemas with lots of duplicates)  add support for an http endpoint to support Prometheus metrics  allow javascript filters to access the row query object  javascript filters now run in the bootstrap process  support for non-latin1 column names  add  --output_schema_id  option  better handling of packet-too-big errors from Kinesis  add message.publish.age metric   v1.17.1 : \"ay, ay, ay\"   fix a regression around filters + bootstrapping  fix a regression around filters + database-only-ddl   v1.17.0 : \"monday, not sunday tuesday\"  v1.17.0 brings a new level of configurability by allowing you to inject\na bit of javascript into maxwell's processing.  Should be useful!  Also:   fix regression for Alibaba RDS tables   v1.16.1 : \"the 90 degree angle thing\"   Fix Bootstrapping for JSON columns  add --recapture_schema flag for when ya wanna start over  add kafka 1.0 libraries, make them default   v1.16.0 : \"kind of sort of a reference to something\"  v1.16.0 brings a rewrite of Maxwell's filtering system, giving it a\nconcise list of rules that are executed in sequence.  It's now possible\nto exclude tables from a particular database, exclude columns matching a\nvalue, and probably some other use cases.\nSee http://maxwells-daemon.io/config/#filtering for details.  v1.15.0 : \"I'm sure I'm being supportive here.\"  This is a bug-fix release, but it's big enough I'm giving it a minor\nversion.   Fix a very old bug in which DDL rows were writing the  start  of the\nrow into  maxwell.positions , leading to chaos in some scenarios where\nmaxwell managed to stop on the row and double-process it, as well as to\na few well-meaning patches.  Fix the fact that maxwell was outputting \"next-position\" instead of\n\"position\" of a row into JSON.  Fix the master-recovery code to store schema that corresponds to the\nstart of a row, and points the replicator at the next-position.   Much thanks to Tim, Likun and others in sorting this mess out.  v1.14.7 : \"casamir pulaski day\"   add RowMap#getRowQuery, thx @saimon7  revert alpine-linux docker image fiasco  fix RawJSONString not serializable, thx @niuhaifeng   v1.14.6 : \"gimme one sec, I need to grab something\"   Fix docker image   v1.14.5 : \"he looks funny, he moves funny\"   reduce docker image footprint  add benchmarking framework  performance improvements for date/datetime columns  fix parser error on UPGRADE PARTITIONING   v1.14.4 : \"chinese food\"   Fix race condition in SchemaCapturer   v1.14.3 : \"what's for lunch?\"   Enable jvm metrics   v1.14.2 : \"bork bork bork\"   fix regression in 1.14.1 around bootstrapping host detection  fix heartbeating code around table includes   v1.14.1 : \"half asleep in frog pajamas\"   bootstraps can now take a client_id  improved config validation for embedded mode   v1.14.0 : \"cats, cats, more cats.  sadness at lack of cats.\"   new feature  --output_xoffset  to uniquely identify rows within transactions,\n  thx Jens Gyti  Bug fixes around \"0000-00-00\" times.

If maxwell can't shut down (because the kafka\n   producer is in a bad state and  close()  never terminates, for example),\n   it would previously stall and process no messages. Now, shutdown is run\n   in a separate thread and there is an additional watchdog thread which\n   forcibly kills the maxwell process if it can't shut down within 10\n   seconds.  Initial support for running maxwell from java, rather then as its own\n   process. This mode of operation is still experimental, but we'll\n   accept PRs to improve it (thanks Geoff Lywood).  Fix incorrect handling of negative (pre-epoch dates) when using\n   binlog_connector mode (thanks Geoff Lywood).   v1.10.3 : \"1.10.2-and-a-bit\"   tiny release to fix a units error in the  replication.lag  metric\n   (subtracting seconds from milliseconds)   v1.10.2 : \"just in time for tomorrow\"   added metrics: \"replication.queue.time\" and \"inflightmessages.count\"  renamed \"time.overall\" metric to \"message.publish.time\"  documentation updates (thanks Chintan Tank)   v1.10.1 : \"forgive and forget\"  The observable changes in this minor release are a new configuration for Kafka/Kinesis producer to abort processing on publish errors, and support of Kafka 0.10.2. Also a bunch of good refactoring has been done for heartbeat processing. List of changes:      Support Kafka 0.10.2     Stop procesing RDS hearbeats     Keep maxwell heartbeat going every 10 seconds when database is quiet     Allow for empty double-quoted string literals for database schema changes     Ignore Kafka/Kinesis producer errors based on new configuration ignore_producer_error   v1.10.0 : \"slightly more ones than zeroes\"  This is a small release, primarily around a change to how schemas are\nstored. Maxwell now stores the  last_heartbeat_read  with each entry\nin the  schemas  table, making schema management more resilient to\ncases where binlog numbers are reused, but means that you must take\ncare if you need to roll back to an earlier version. If you deploy\nv1.10.0, then roll back to an earlier version, you should manually\nupdate all  schemas . last_heartbeat_read  values to  0  before\nredeploying v1.10.0 or higher.  Other minor changes:   allow negative default numbers in columns  only store final binlog position if it has changed  blacklist internal aurora table `rds_heartbeat*'  log4j version bump (allows for one entry per line JSON logging)   v1.9.0 : \"now with added whimsy\"  Maxwell 1.9 adds one main feature: monitoring support, contributed by\nScott Ferguson. Multiple backends can be configured, read the updated\ndocs for full details.  There's also some bugfixes:   filter DDL messages based on config  determine newest schema from binlog order, not creation order  add task manager to shutdown cleanly on error  minor logging improvements   v1.8.2 : \"just as the postcards wept\"  Bugfix release.   maxwell would crash on a quoted partition name  fixes for alters on non-string tables containing VARCHAR  use seconds instead of milliseconds for DDL messages   v1.8.1 : \"famous is faster, don't have to be talented\"   performance improves in capturing and restoring schema, thx Joren\n  Minnaert  Allow for capturing from a separate mysql host (adds support for using\n  Maxscale as a replication proxy), thx Adam Szkoda   v1.8.0 : \"upbeat, honest, contradictory\"  In version 1.8.0 Maxwell gains alpha support for GTID-based positions!\nAll praise due to Henry Cai.  v1.7.2 : \"comparing self to better\"   Fix a bug found where maxwell could cache the wrong TABLE_MAP_ID for a\n  binlog event, leading to crashes or in some cases data mismatches.   v1.7.1 : \"blame it on your seratonin\"   bootstrapping now can take a  --where  clause  performance improvements in the kafka producer   v1.7.0 : \"lucky me, lucky mud\"  Maxwell 1.7 brings 2 major new, alpha features.  The first is Mysql 5.7\nsupport, including JSON column type support and handling of 5.7 SQL, but not  including GTID support yet.  This is based on porting Maxwell to\nStanley Shyko's binlog-connector library.  Thanks to Stanley for his\namazing support doing this port.  The second major new feature is a producer for Amazon's Kinesis streams,\nThis was contributed in full by the dogged and persistent Thomas Dziedzic.\nCheck it out with  --producer=kinesis .  There's also some bugfixes:\n- Amazon RDS heartbeat events now tick maxwell's position, thx Scott Ferguson\n- allow CHECK() statements inside column definitions  v1.6.0 : \"give me a quest\"  This is mostly a bugfix release, but it gets a minor version bump due to\na single change of behavior: dates and timestamps which mysql may\naccept, but are considered invalid (0000-00-00 is a notable example)\npreviously had inconsistent behavior.  Now we convert these to NULL.\nOther bugfixes:\n- heartbeats have moved into their own table\n- more fixes around alibaba rds\n- ignore DELETE statements that are output for MEMORY tables upon server\n  restart\n- allow pointing maxwell to a pre-existing database  v1.5.2 : \"french banana\"   add support for kafka 0.10.1 @ smferguson  master recovery: cleanup positions from previous master; prevent\n  errors on flip-back.  fix a bug that would trigger in certain cases when dropping a column\n  that was part of the primary-key   v1.5.1 : \"1.5.1 is just 1.5.1\"  This is a bugfix release.\n- fixes for bootstrapping with an alternative maxwell-schema name and an\n   include_database  filter, thanks Lucian Jones\n- fixes for kafka 0.10 with lz4 compression, thanks Scott Ferguson\n- ignore the RDS table  mysql.ha_health_check  table\n- Get the bootstrapping process to output NULL values.\n- fix a quoting issue in the bootstrap code, thanks @mylesjao.  v1.5.0 : \"someone, somewhere, is still smoking cigarettes, damnit\"   CHANGE: Kafka producer no longer ships with hard-coded defaults.\n  Please ensure you have \"compression.type\", \"metadata.fetch.timeout.ms\", and \"retries\"\n  configured to your liking.  bugfix: fix a regression in handling  ALTER TABLE change c int after b  statements  warn on servers with missing server_id   v1.4.2 : \"drawer cat is back\"   kafka 0.10.0 support, as well as a re-working of the --kafka_version\n  command line option.   v1.4.1 : \"cat snores\"   support per-table topics, Thanks @smferguson and @sschatts.  fix a parser issue with DROP COLUMN CASCADE, thanks @smferguson   v1.4.0 : \"deep, insomniac character flaws\"  1.4.0 brings us two nice new features:\n- partition-by-column: see --kafka_partition_columns.

To disable this and restore the old functionality where fields\n  were omitted, pass  --output_nulls=false  Fix an issue with multi-client support where two replicators would\n  ping-pong heartbeats at each other  Fix an issue where a client would attempt to recover a position from a\n  mismatched client_id  Fix a bug when using CHANGE COLUMN on a primary key   v1.2.1 : \"point-ones are a sad and inevitable fact\"  This is a bugfix release.\n- fix a parser bug around ALTER TABLE CHARACTER SET\n- fix bin/maxwell to pull in the proper version of the kafka-clients\n  library  v1.2.0 : \"just here, not to talk to you\"  1.2.0 is a major release of Maxwell that introduces master recovery\nfeatures; when a slave is promoted to master, Maxwell is now capable of\nrecovering the position.  See the  --master_recovery  flag for more\ndetails.  It also upgrades the kafka producer library to 0.9.  If you're using\nmaxwell with a kafka 0.8 server, you must now pass the  --kafka0.8  flag\nto maxwell.  v1.1.6 : \"pithy\"   minor bugfix in which maxwell with --replay mode was trying to write\n  heartbeats   v1.1.5 : \"my brain is a polluted mess\"   @dadah89 adds --output_binlog_position to optionally output the\n  position with the row  @dadah89 adds --output_commit_info to turn off xid/commit fields  maxwell now supports tables with partitions  maxwell now supports N maxwells per-server.  see the client_id /\n  replica_server_id options.  two parser fixes, for engine= innodb  and CHARSET ASCII  lay the ground work for doing master recovery; we add a heartbeat into\n  the positions table that we can co-ordinate around.   v1.1.4 : \"george flunk\"   add support for a bunch more charsets (gbk, big5, notably)  fix Maxwell's handling of kafka errors - previously we were trying to\n  crash Maxwell by throwing a RuntimeException out of the Kafka\n  Producer, but this was a failure.

It also fixes a couple of bugs in the query parsing path.  v0.5.0 : 0.5.0 -- \"People who put commas in column names deserve undefined behavior\"   maxwell now captures primary keys on tables.  We'll use this to form kafka key names later.  maxwell now outputs to a single topic, hashing the data by database name to keep a database's updates in order.   v0.4.0 : 0.4.0, \"unboxed cat\"  v0.4.0 fixes some bugs with long-lived mysql connections by adding connection pooling support.  v0.3.0 : 0.3.0  This version fixes a fairly nasty bug in which the binlog-position flush thread was sharing a connection with the rest of the system, leading to crashes.   It also enables kafka gzip compression by default.  v0.2.2 : 0.2.2  Version 0.2.2 sets up the LANG environment variable, which fixes a bug in utf-8 handling.   v0.2.1 : v0.2.1  version 0.2.1 makes Maxwell ignore CREATE INDEX ddl statements and others.  v0.2.0 : 0.2.0  This release gets Maxwell storing the last-written binlog position inside the mysql master itself.   v0.1.4 : 0.1.4  support --position_file param  v0.1.3 : 0.1.3  Adds kafka command line options.  v0.1.1 : 0.1.1  v0.1.1, a small bugfix release.   v0.1 : 0.1  This is the first possible release of Maxwell that might work.
